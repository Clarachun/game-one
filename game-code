apexOne = '''\n\nthe bright lights in the dark of the nighttime tug at the edges of your eyes,
hurting your head. the rain drips onto you every once in a while. most of the
buildings shield you from the rain. people laugh and there are couples kissing
in the streets. you look around the neighborhood, searching for whomever you are
here for. you see a bar to your right, and a boy smoking to your left. forward
is a building which seems oddly familiar.\n'''

tenBuildOne = '''\n\nyou walk towards the the apartment building, entranced by your deja vu
and the feeling that you've been there before. you head towards the building
and stop at the steps of the tennement building, lifting your chin up as if to
meet the rain. and you remeber. you live here. this is your home. you walk up
to the stairs and punch in your numbers, and the door beeps as you step into
the building. there's a coupe making out in the corner of your eye, and you
quickly walk past them out of respect, lowering your head. this building is dim
and dark. you wonder when was the last time you came here. you don't remember.
you don't remember a lot of things.'''

boyOne = '''\n\nyour feet hit the ground as you walk towards the boy, giving a bright, and
clever looking smile at him. he doesn't look up.\n
' hey.' you say, and he glances up at you and almost seems to glare through
your skull.\n
'hi.' he replies. his hair is a made out of soft black feathers that almost
looks like hair. it catches you by surprise. he's not human. here, on
pontusdam, that's unusual.\n
'what's your name?' you ask. and he glances up breifly, raising an eyebrow
at, you wonder if he'll lie or not. you think he might.\n
'lewis.' his tone is uncomfortable as he says this. 'you?'''

boyOneP2 = '''
'we've been looking for you all night.' he begins, and pulls the cigarette
out of his mouth with a laugh. 'after you went missing last night we were
worried.' he shrugs and laughs again. that laugh is so familiar, and
something about it rubs your the wrong way.'''

boyOneP3 = '''\nyour facial features softly contort into that of passive staring, as his
own garner a look of anger and sadness. passing between the two as if he
was feeling both at the very same time. he simply sighs and rubs the bridge
of his nose, before grabbing you by the wrist.\n'''

boyOneP4 = ''' 'let's go.' He begins to tug at your wrist. it hurts. and preceeds to 
drag you along with him. 'fuck. of course you pull this shit on us. of
fucking course.' he pulls the cigarette out of his mouth and tosses it
onto the ground, as he turns around and begins to tug you along you notice
the bulges in the back of his shirt, a mishapen lumpen luck that makes
you frown lightly.'''

boyOneP5 = '''he tugs you along still and you don't know what's going on. he leads you
through the maze like streets. right left right left right left. jump
jump. stairs. right left. it's a mixed up feeling in your mind before
you stop in front of a beautiful door with a beautiful boy with soft
brown hair and a smile that makes you want to smile.'''

boyOneP6 = ''' "hi ateren. hi..." he stops and looks straight at you, his face
contorts into a sense of worry of his own, before bursting forward and
hugging you tight. 'we thought you were dead in some toilet room or
something' he mutters into your ear.'''

boyOneP7 = '''ateren takes a step forward and taps the shoulder of the boy with the
soft brown hair who steps back, and whispers something into his ear.
you know they're talking about you. how you should remember something,
and yet your mind is as blank as that of a newborn babies.'''

boyOneP8 = '''tabula rasa. the term floats to your mind. you push it aside.\n
'oh. sorry.' he says, and extends his hand. his skin almost shimmers
under the light like it's not made for this sun.\n
you take it in your own and shake it. 'hi. i'm...' he pauses you as you
speak and simply says.'''

boyOneP9 = ''' 'we've met already.' before looking to ateren, and suddenly you're
nameless again. 'you're back early ateren. you were supposed to grab
us dinner.' he frowns. ateren just shrugs.\n '''

boyOneP10A = ''' 'i was checking out if she'd stopped by her apartment anytime soon.' that
catches you by surprise. your apartment. you didn't know you if had one
of those. that's weird. you think you'd know if you had one of those.\n
'was ro there?' brown haired tilts his head. ateren shakes his head. 'she
seems to be gone.' '''

boyOneP10E = ''' 'i was. until i saw emmanuel here. give me a break. i got your favourite.
the boy huffs, and tosses a bag full of something that somehow smells
disgusting and yet delicious at the other boy.\n
'where'd you find her?' he asks, pulling out something and beginning to
chew on it happily.\n
'i didn't. she found me.' the other one nods. it's written over his face.
he's thinking clever girl. that somehow feels like an insult. you're better
than clever. right?'''

boyOneP10G = ''' 'did't feel like it.' he shrugs, and you look around briefly. softly confused.
'anyways. grey here found me and i figured that's more urgent than your black
hole that you bother to call a stomach.' the other one rolls his eyes again
and looks back at you. 'you don't mind. do you grey?' you have no idea what
exactly he's asking of you.'''

protestAteren = ''' you begin to fight back. kicking and hitting the best that you can. and
for  moment you think you might be winning. you seem surprisingly good at
kicking, and somehow that provides you with consolation. you're not inept?
you guess? you might be still, and it might be that you're just good at
kicking.\n

apartment = """'umm... what apartment?' you ask, and jiya looks at your quickly.\n
'yours.' jiya says in reply, and pats that beautiful looking hair. 'it's where
you live when you don't want to be here.' he says in reply. 'you bought it a bit
back... you figured if we were living here this long you might as well have a...
uh... actual place to live.' he offers up a smile to you, and you nod. wondering
how long you've been living here."""

openDoor = """the door opens up to the reveal another person with soft brown hair. but this one is
different. less... scary looking? and they almost seem nicer. trying to tell their
gender is a nearly impossible thing. you wonder a little if they have one.\n
'you're awake.' they mutter. and you nod, slowly but surely. 'good. get dressed.' they
walk over to something you presume to be a closet, and open it up, pulling out a small
black square and tossing it at you with a pointed stare. you fumble for a bit before
catching it, and frowning at it. turning it over in your hands. you don't know
what this is."""

blkSqr = """'what is this?' you ask. \n
the brown haired one stares in disbelief. 'clothing dipshit. ria. you really can't remember
shit. can you?' you shake your head in reply, and they bury their head in one hand 'okay then.'
they mutter from their hands. 'we're going to show you how to get dressed.' they sigh and walk
over. they lift up your hair, you try to yank away, they yank you back, before patting a square
on the back of your neck that you really hadn't felt before. they pull out something already
there and hand it to you.\n
it's another black square, and suddenly you have on no clothes. they grab the other one from
your palm and push it into that hole in the back of your neck, and the clothes are back. you
gawp at the feeling and sight of all of this.\n

all meeting up. even you.'"""

mind. 'where are we going?' you hesitantly ask.\n

that. you don't know if you want to. you can't help but wonder what they're meeting about
this seems oddly urgent, and yet you have no idea what the urgency is about. so what use
would you be?\n
